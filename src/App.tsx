      <h2 id="introduction">Hiya! I'm Valerie!</h2>
      <p id="introduction-text">
        Thanks for checking out my portfolio. I do a lot of different things in
        the programming sphere. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science,
        where I focused on networking and cybersecurity. I have a passion for
        web development and build apps using React in my spare time, but I also
        enjoy backend development and DevOps tasks. Professionally, I develop
        Groovy applications for a large insurance company in Grand Rapids.

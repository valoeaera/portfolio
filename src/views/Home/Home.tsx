      <p id="introduction-text">
        Thanks for checking out my portfolio. I do a lot of different things in the programming sphere. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, where I focused on networking and cybersecurity. I enjoy web development and build apps using React in my spare time, but I also enjoy backend development and DevOps tasks. Professionally, I have experience developing web applications, managing development workflows and infrastructure, and I currently develop Groovy integrations for a large insurance company in Grand Rapids.
